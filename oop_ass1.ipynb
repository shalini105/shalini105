    "### **Q1. Class and Object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class**:  \n",
    "  A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects of that class will have.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object**:  \n",
    "  An instance of a class. It is a specific realization of the blueprint provided by the class, with its own values for the attributes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"The engine of {self.brand} {self.model} is starting...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",
    "my_car.start_engine()\n",
    "# Output: The engine of Toyota Corolla is starting...\n",
    "```\n",

    "### **Q2. The Four Pillars of OOPs**\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**:  \n",
    "   Wrapping data and methods together into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some components. Example: Private variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inheritance**:  \n",
    "   Mechanism for a new class to acquire the properties and methods of an existing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism**:  \n",
    "   Ability to take multiple forms. Example: Same method name behaving differently in different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Abstraction**:  \n",
    "   Hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3. Purpose of `__init__()` in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `__init__()` method is the **constructor** in Python. It is called automatically when an object of the class is created and is used to initialize the attributes of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def introduce(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"My name is {self.name}, and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object\n",
    "student1 = Student(\"Alice\", 20)\n",
    "student1.introduce()\n",
    "# Output: My name is Alice, and I am 20 years old.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q4. Why `self` is Used in OOPs?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `self` keyword is used to refer to the **current instance** of the class.\n",
    "- It is used to access attributes and methods of the class in Python.\n",
    "- While defining methods, the first parameter is always `self`, which ensures that the method is bound to the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, breed):\n",
    "        self.breed = breed  # Refers to the instance's breed attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"A {self.breed} is barking!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Labrador\")\n",
    "dog1.bark()\n",
    "# Output: A Labrador is barking!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q5. Inheritance and Its Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance**:  \n",
    "  The mechanism by which a new class (child) derives properties and methods from an existing class (parent). This allows code reuse and hierarchical relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Types of Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance**:  \n",
    "   One child class inherits from one parent class.  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Parent:\n",
    "       def greet(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Hello from Parent!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child(Parent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   obj = Child()\n",
    "   obj.greet()  # Output: Hello from Parent!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance**:  \n",
    "   One child class inherits from multiple parent classes.  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Parent1:\n",
    "       def feature1(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Feature from Parent1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Parent2:\n",
    "       def feature2(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Feature from Parent2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child(Parent1, Parent2):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   obj = Child()\n",
    "   obj.feature1()  # Output: Feature from Parent1\n",
    "   obj.feature2()  # Output: Feature from Parent2\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multilevel Inheritance**:  \n",
    "   A class inherits from another class, which in turn inherits from another class.  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Grandparent:\n",
    "       def greet(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Hello from Grandparent!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Parent(Grandparent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child(Parent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   obj = Child()\n",
    "   obj.greet()  # Output: Hello from Grandparent!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**:  \n",
    "   Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Parent:\n",
    "       def greet(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Hello from Parent!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child1(Parent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child2(Parent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   obj1 = Child1()\n",
    "   obj1.greet()  # Output: Hello from Parent!\n",
    "   obj2 = Child2()\n",
    "   obj2.greet()  # Output: Hello from Parent!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hybrid Inheritance**:  \n",
    "   A combination of two or more types of inheritance.  \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Parent:\n",
    "       def greet(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Hello from Parent!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child1(Parent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child2(Parent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class GrandChild(Child1, Child2):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   obj = GrandChild()\n",
    "   obj.greet()  # Output: Hello from Parent!\n",
    "   ```"
