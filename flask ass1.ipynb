    "### Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the Advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flask Framework:**\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, designed for building web applications. It is classified as a microframework because it does not include some of the more advanced features that larger frameworks like Django provide out of the box. Instead, it provides the essential tools for web development and allows developers to use additional libraries and tools as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Flask:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplicity and Flexibility:**\n",
    "   - Flask is minimalistic and unopinionated, meaning it provides the core tools needed to build a web application but does not enforce a specific project structure or components. This allows developers to structure their applications in the way they prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lightweight:**\n",
    "   - Flask’s core is lightweight, making it easy to understand and use. It includes only the essentials and lets developers add components or libraries as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extensibility:**\n",
    "   - Flask supports a wide range of extensions that add functionality such as form handling, authentication, and database integration. This modularity allows developers to add only the features they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Easy to Learn:**\n",
    "   - Flask has a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy for new developers to get started with web development in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Built-in Development Server:**\n",
    "   - Flask includes a built-in development server, which simplifies the process of testing and debugging during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Integration with Other Tools:**\n",
    "   - Flask can be easily integrated with other libraries and tools for tasks such as database management (SQLAlchemy), form validation (WTForms), and authentication (Flask-Security).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Jinja2 Templating:**\n",
    "   - Flask uses Jinja2 as its templating engine, which is powerful and flexible, allowing developers to generate dynamic HTML pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Create a Simple Flask Application to Display ‘Hello World!!’. Attach the Screenshot of the Output in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the Flask application\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "    return 'Hello World!!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to run:**\n",
    "1. Save the code in a file named `app.py`.\n",
    "2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.\n",
    "3. Run the Flask application with the command `python app.py`.\n",
    "4. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Screenshot:**\n",
    "You can take a screenshot of the output by visiting the URL in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is App Routing in Flask? Why Do We Use App Routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**App Routing in Flask:**\n",
    "App routing in Flask refers to the mechanism of mapping URLs to Python functions that handle requests to those URLs. This is done using the `@app.route()` decorator to bind a URL pattern to a view function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Do We Use App Routes:**\n",
    "1. **Define URL Endpoints:**\n",
    "   - Routes help define the URL structure of the web application and specify what content or functionality should be served at each URL endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handle HTTP Requests:**\n",
    "   - Routes map different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) to specific functions that handle the corresponding logic, allowing for dynamic responses based on user input or other parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Separation of Concerns:**\n",
    "   - Routing allows for a clean separation between the URL structure and the logic that handles requests, making the code more organized and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dynamic Routing:**\n",
    "   - Routes can include dynamic segments that allow for flexible URL patterns, such as `/<username>`, which can be used to capture and process variable parts of the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Create a “/welcome” Route to Display the Welcome Message and a “/” Route to Show Company Details. Attach the Screenshot of the Output in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the Flask application\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return '''\n",
    "    Company Name: ABC Corporation<br>\n",
    "    Location: India<br>\n",
    "    Contact Detail: 999-999-9999\n",
    "    '''\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/welcome')\n",
    "def welcome():\n",
    "    return 'Welcome to ABC Corporation'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to run:**\n",
    "1. Save the code in a file named `app.py`.\n",
    "2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.\n",
    "3. Run the Flask application with `python app.py`.\n",
    "4. Open a web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to view the company details and `http://127.0.0.1:5000/welcome` to see the welcome message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Screenshot:**\n",
    "You can take a screenshot of both URLs in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What Function is Used in Flask for URL Building? Write a Python Code to Demonstrate the Working of the `url_for()` Function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**URL Building Function:**\n",
    "In Flask, the `url_for()` function is used to build URLs for a specific function dynamically. This helps avoid hardcoding URLs and makes it easier to manage and update routes in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, url_for, render_template_string\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return render_template_string('''\n",
    "    <h1>Welcome to ABC Corporation</h1>\n",
    "    <p><a href=\"{{ url_for('welcome') }}\">Go to Welcome Page</a></p>\n",
    "    ''')\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/welcome')\n",
    "def welcome():\n",
    "    return 'Welcome to ABC Corporation'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `url_for('welcome')` generates the URL for the `welcome` route. When used in the `render_template_string`, it dynamically creates the link to the `/welcome` endpoint.\n",
    "- The `url_for()` function ensures that if the URL for the `welcome` route changes, the link will be updated automatically, maintaining consistency across the application."
