    "### Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database:**\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS) which provide tools to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL vs. NoSQL Databases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SQL Databases:**\n",
    "  - **Definition:** SQL (Structured Query Language) databases use structured query language for defining and manipulating data. They are relational databases where data is organized into tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "  - **Schema:** Fixed schema, meaning the structure (tables, columns) is defined beforehand and must be followed.\n",
    "  - **ACID Compliance:** SQL databases are ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring reliable transactions.\n",
    "  - **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "  - **Use Case:** Ideal for applications requiring complex queries, transactional integrity, and structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NoSQL Databases:**\n",
    "  - **Definition:** NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases designed for more flexible data models. They handle various types of data including key-value pairs, wide-column stores, graph databases, and document stores.\n",
    "  - **Schema:** Schema-less or dynamic schema, allowing the data structure to evolve over time.\n",
    "  - **Scalability:** Generally better suited for horizontal scaling (adding more servers).\n",
    "  - **Examples:** MongoDB (document store), Cassandra (wide-column store), Redis (key-value store), Neo4j (graph database).\n",
    "  - **Use Case:** Suitable for applications with large volumes of unstructured data, requiring flexible schemas and horizontal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DDL (Data Definition Language):**\n",
    "DDL is a subset of SQL used for defining and managing database schemas and structures. It deals with the creation, modification, and removal of database objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CREATE:**\n",
    "  - **Usage:** Creates new tables, databases, indexes, or other database objects.\n",
    "  - **Example:** \n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "        ID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "        Name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "        Position VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "    );\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Explanation:** This creates a table named `Employees` with columns for `ID`, `Name`, and `Position`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DROP:**\n",
    "  - **Usage:** Deletes existing tables, databases, indexes, or other database objects.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Explanation:** This deletes the `Employees` table and all its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ALTER:**\n",
    "  - **Usage:** Modifies the structure of an existing database object such as a table.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE Employees ADD DateOfBirth DATE;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Explanation:** This adds a new column `DateOfBirth` to the `Employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TRUNCATE:**\n",
    "  - **Usage:** Removes all rows from a table, but the table structure remains.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Explanation:** This deletes all records from the `Employees` table but does not remove the table itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DML (Data Manipulation Language):**\n",
    "DML is a subset of SQL used for manipulating data within existing database structures. It handles querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **INSERT:**\n",
    "  - **Usage:** Adds new rows to a table.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Position)\n",
    "    VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'Software Engineer');\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Explanation:** This adds a new record to the `Employees` table with `ID` 1, `Name` 'John Doe', and `Position` 'Software Engineer'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UPDATE:**\n",
    "  - **Usage:** Modifies existing rows in a table.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    UPDATE Employees\n",
    "    SET Position = 'Senior Software Engineer'\n",
    "    WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Explanation:** This updates the `Position` of the employee with `ID` 1 to 'Senior Software Engineer'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DELETE:**\n",
    "  - **Usage:** Removes rows from a table.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    DELETE FROM Employees\n",
    "    WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Explanation:** This deletes the record from the `Employees` table where the `ID` is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQL (Data Query Language):**\n",
    "DQL is a subset of SQL used for querying and retrieving data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SELECT:**\n",
    "  - **Usage:** Retrieves data from one or more tables.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT Name, Position\n",
    "    FROM Employees\n",
    "    WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Explanation:** This retrieves the `Name` and `Position` of the employee with `ID` 1 from the `Employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Key:**\n",
    "  - **Definition:** A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each record is unique and not null.\n",
    "  - **Usage:** It is used to uniquely identify a record and establish relationships with other tables.\n",
    "  - **Example:** In a table `Employees`, `ID` could be a primary key ensuring that each employee has a unique `ID`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foreign Key:**\n",
    "  - **Definition:** A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes and enforces a link between the two tables.\n",
    "  - **Usage:** It is used to maintain referential integrity between tables.\n",
    "  - **Example:** In a `Orders` table, `EmployeeID` could be a foreign key referencing the `ID` in the `Employees` table, linking orders to employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Write a Python code to connect MySQL to Python. Explain the `cursor()` and `execute()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code to Connect MySQL:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish the connection\n",
    "conn = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "    user=\"yourusername\",\n",
    "    password=\"yourpassword\",\n",
    "    database=\"yourdatabase\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a cursor object\n",
    "cursor = conn.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute an SQL query\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM Employees\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch and print the results\n",
    "results = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "for row in results:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the cursor and connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "conn.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`cursor()`:** \n",
    "  - **Purpose:** Creates a cursor object which is used to interact with the database. It allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch results.\n",
    "  - **Usage:** `cursor = conn.cursor()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`execute()`:**\n",
    "  - **Purpose:** Executes a SQL query. This method takes a SQL query as an argument and performs the operation defined by the query.\n",
    "  - **Usage:** `cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM Employees\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query. in detail\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of execution of SQL clauses in a query is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM:** \n",
    "   - Specifies the tables or views from which to retrieve data. The FROM clause is processed first to determine the dataset on which other operations will be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **JOIN:** \n",
    "   - Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Join operations are typically performed after the FROM clause to form a combined dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ON:** \n",
    "   - Specifies the condition for the JOIN operation. It determines how the tables are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **WHERE:** \n",
    "   - Filters records based on specified conditions. The WHERE clause is used to exclude rows that do not meet the criteria from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **GROUP BY:** \n",
    "   - Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows. Often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc., to perform operations on each group of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **HAVING:** \n",
    "   - Filters groups based on a condition. It is used after the GROUP BY clause to filter the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **SELECT:** \n",
    "   - Specifies the columns to be returned in the result set. The SELECT clause determines which columns or calculations will be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **DISTINCT:** \n",
    "   - Removes duplicate rows from the result set. It is applied after the SELECT clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **ORDER BY:** \n",
    "   - Sorts the result set based on one or more columns. The ORDER BY clause is used to arrange the data in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **LIMIT/OFFSET:** \n",
    "    - Limits the number of rows returned in the result set. OFFSET specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows. Used for pagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Query:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Name, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE Department = 'Sales'\n",
    "GROUP BY Name\n",
    "HAVING AVG(Salary) > 50000\n",
    "ORDER BY AvgSalary DESC\n",
    "LIMIT 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Order of Execution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM Employees**\n",
    "2. **WHERE Department = 'Sales'**\n",
    "3. **GROUP BY Name**\n",
    "4. **HAVING AVG(Salary) > 50000**\n",
    "5. **SELECT Name, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary**\n",
    "6. **ORDER BY AvgSalary DESC**\n",
    "7. **LIMIT 10**"
