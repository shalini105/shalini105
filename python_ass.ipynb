    "Sure, let's explain each of these operators with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### (i) `/` Operator (Division)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `/` operator is used for division in Python. It divides the left operand by the right operand and returns a float value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Division\n",
    "result = 10 / 3\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `10 / 3` results in `3.3333333333333335`, which is a float because even though the operands are integers, division in Python always returns a float if the result isn't an exact integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (ii) `%` Operator (Modulus)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `%` operator returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Modulus\n",
    "remainder = 10 % 3\n",
    "print(remainder)  # Output: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `10 % 3` returns `1` because 10 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (iii) `//` Operator (Floor Division)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `//` operator performs floor division, which divides the left operand by the right operand and rounds down to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Floor division\n",
    "result = 10 // 3\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `10 // 3` returns `3`, which is the integer part of the division result `3.3333...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (iv) `**` Operator (Exponentiation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `**` operator is used for exponentiation, where the left operand is raised to the power of the right operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Exponentiation\n",
    "result = 2 ** 3\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "- Initially, `A` is divisible by `B` (`100 % 5 == 0`), so we enter the `while` loop.\n",
    "- Inside the loop, `A` is divided by `B` (`100 // 5 = 20`), and `count` is incremented to `1`.\n",

    "- Therefore, `A` was divisible by `B` 2 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note:\n",
    "- The `while` loop continues as long as `A % B == 0`, ensuring that `A` is divisible by `B`.\n",
    "- Each time `A` is divided by `B`, `A` is updated (`A = A // B`) and `count` is incremented to keep track of how many times `A` was divisible by `B`.\n",
    "- If initially `A` is not divisible by `B` (`A % B != 0`), the loop will not execute at all, and `count` will remain `0`.\n",
