    "### **Q1. What is multithreading in Python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multithreading** in Python refers to running multiple threads simultaneously within a single process. A thread is a lightweight unit of a process, and multithreading allows multiple threads to run concurrently, sharing the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it used?**\n",
    "- To improve the performance of I/O-bound tasks like reading or writing to files, network communication, or database operations.\n",
    "- To handle tasks in parallel, improving the efficiency of programs.\n",
    "- To make applications responsive by executing long-running tasks in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module Used:**\n",
    "- The `threading` module is used to create and manage threads in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2. Why is the threading module used? Write the use of the following functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `threading` module provides functionality to create and control threads in Python. It offers functions and classes to handle threads efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`activeCount()`**:\n",
    "   - Returns the number of thread objects that are currently active.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "     print(\"Active threads:\", threading.activeCount())\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`currentThread()`**:\n",
    "   - Returns the thread object corresponding to the current thread of execution.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "     print(\"Current thread:\", threading.currentThread().name)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`enumerate()`**:\n",
    "   - Returns a list of all thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "     print(\"Threads:\", threading.enumerate())\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3. Explain the following functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`run()`**:\n",
    "   - The method contains the code that the thread executes. It is called internally when the thread's `start()` method is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`start()`**:\n",
    "   - Begins the threadâ€™s execution by internally calling the `run()` method.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "     def task():\n",
    "         print(\"Thread is running.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     thread = threading.Thread(target=task)\n",
    "     thread.start()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`join()`**:\n",
    "   - Waits for the thread to complete execution before proceeding with the rest of the program.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     thread.join()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`isAlive()`**:\n",
    "   - Returns `True` if the thread is still active, `False` otherwise. (Deprecated in Python 3.9+; use `is_alive()` instead.)\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     print(thread.is_alive())\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **Q4. Write a Python program to create two threads: One prints squares, and the other prints cubes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_squares():\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        print(f\"Square of {i}: {i**2}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_cubes():\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        print(f\"Cube of {i}: {i**3}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create threads\n",
    "thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_squares)\n",
    "thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_cubes)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start threads\n",
    "thread1.start()\n",
    "thread2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for threads to complete\n",
    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Done!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q5. State the advantages and disadvantages of multithreading.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Concurrency:** Allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, improving responsiveness.\n",
    "2. **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Threads share the same memory space, reducing overhead.\n",
    "3. **Improved Application Performance:** Ideal for I/O-bound tasks like network or file I/O.\n",
    "4. **Responsiveness:** Enables background tasks to run without blocking the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):** Python's GIL prevents true parallel execution of threads, limiting CPU-bound task performance.\n",
    "2. **Complex Debugging:** Multithreaded programs can be challenging to debug due to issues like race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "3. **Context Switching Overhead:** Frequent switching between threads may cause performance degradation.\n",
    "4. **Limited Scalability:** Threads are not as scalable as multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Deadlocks:**\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources, causing all of them to get stuck indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Thread A locks Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2.\n",
    "- Thread B locks Resource 2 and waits for Resource 1.\n",
    "- Neither thread can proceed, resulting in a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Use a timeout while acquiring locks.\n",
    "- Avoid circular dependencies by using a consistent resource allocation order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "lock1 = threading.Lock()\n",
    "lock2 = threading.Lock()\n",
    "\n",
    "def thread1_task():\n",
    "    with lock1:\n",
    "        print(\"Thread 1 acquired lock1\")\n",
    "        with lock2:\n",
    "            print(\"Thread 1 acquired lock2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def thread2_task():\n",
    "    with lock2:\n",
    "        print(\"Thread 2 acquired lock2\")\n",
    "        with lock1:\n",
    "            print(\"Thread 2 acquired lock1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "thread1 = threading.Thread(target=thread1_task)\n",
    "thread2 = threading.Thread(target=thread2_task)\n",
    "\n",
    "thread1.start()\n",
    "thread2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Race Conditions:**\n",
    "A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously, and the outcome depends on the thread execution order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Two threads increment a shared counter. Without proper synchronization, both may read the same initial value, causing incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Use synchronization mechanisms like locks or semaphores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "lock = threading.Lock()\n",
    "\n",
    "def increment():\n",
    "    global counter\n",
    "    for _ in range(1000):\n",
    "        with lock:\n",
    "            counter += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "threads = [threading.Thread(target=increment) for _ in range(2)]\n",
    "\n",
    "for thread in threads:\n",
    "    thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "for thread in threads:\n",
    "    thread.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Final counter value:\", counter)\n",
    "```"
