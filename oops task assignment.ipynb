    "### Q1. Create a vehicle class\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a `Vehicle` class with an `__init__` method that initializes `name_of_vehicle`, `max_speed`, and `average_of_vehicle`, you can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name_of_vehicle, max_speed, average_of_vehicle):\n",
    "        self.name_of_vehicle = name_of_vehicle\n",
    "        self.max_speed = max_speed\n",
    "        self.average_of_vehicle = average_of_vehicle\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        return (f\"Vehicle Name: {self.name_of_vehicle}, \"\n",
    "                f\"Max Speed: {self.max_speed} km/h, \"\n",
    "                f\"Average: {self.average_of_vehicle} km/l\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Create a child class `Car` from the `Vehicle` class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Car` class inherits from `Vehicle` and adds a method to return the seating capacity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def seating_capacity(self, capacity):\n",
    "        return f\"The {self.name_of_vehicle} has a seating capacity of {capacity}.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is multiple inheritance? Write a Python code to demonstrate multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple inheritance** occurs when a class inherits from more than one base class. This allows the child class to inherit attributes and methods from all parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Engine:\n",
    "    def engine_type(self):\n",
    "        return \"V8 Engine\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Wheels:\n",
    "    def wheel_type(self):\n",
    "        return \"All-terrain Wheels\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Engine, Wheels):\n",
    "    def car_description(self):\n",
    "        return (f\"This car has a {self.engine_type()} and {self.wheel_type()}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "my_car = Car()\n",
    "print(my_car.car_description())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Car` class inherits from both `Engine` and `Wheels` classes, and can use methods from both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What are getter and setter in Python? Create a class with getter and setter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getters** and **setters** are methods used to access and modify the values of private attributes in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a class with getter and setter methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Getter method\n",
    "    def get_name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__name\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Setter method\n",
    "    def set_name(self, name):\n",
    "        if isinstance(name, str) and name:\n",
    "            self.__name = name\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Invalid name\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "person = Person(\"John\")\n",
    "print(person.get_name())  # Outputs: John\n",
    "person.set_name(\"Doe\")\n",
    "print(person.get_name())  # Outputs: Doe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What is method overriding in Python? Write a Python code to demonstrate method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method overriding** occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows a subclass to tailor or extend the behavior of methods inherited from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Dog barks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Cat meows\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n",
    "\n",
    "for animal in animals:\n",
    "    print(animal.speak())  # Outputs: Dog barks \\n Cat meows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n"
