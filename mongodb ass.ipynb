    "### Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios is it preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "**MongoDB:**\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database designed for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. It uses a flexible, schema-less document-oriented approach, where data is stored in JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). This allows for more complex data structures and faster development iterations compared to traditional relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Relational Databases:**\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle various types of data models that are not strictly tabular (i.e., not organized into rows and columns). They are more flexible in terms of data storage and retrieval, allowing for different data structures such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use MongoDB Over SQL Databases:**\n",
    "- **Schema Flexibility:** MongoDB is preferred when the data structure is likely to evolve, as it does not require a fixed schema.\n",
    "- **Unstructured Data:** It handles unstructured or semi-structured data well, such as JSON documents, which is useful for applications like content management systems or big data applications.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** MongoDB is designed for horizontal scaling and can distribute data across multiple servers, making it suitable for applications requiring high availability and scalability.\n",
    "- **Development Speed:** For projects with rapidly changing requirements or where developers want to iterate quickly, MongoDB’s flexible schema can accelerate development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. State and Explain the Features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document-Oriented Storage:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format. Each document is a JSON-like structure with key-value pairs, making it highly flexible and easily readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Schema Flexibility:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB does not enforce a fixed schema, allowing different documents in the same collection to have different structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, distributing data across multiple servers to handle large datasets and high throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Indexing:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB provides indexing capabilities to improve query performance. You can create indexes on fields to speed up read operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Aggregation Framework:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB’s aggregation framework allows for powerful data processing and transformation operations directly within the database, including grouping, filtering, and sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Replication:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB supports replica sets, providing high availability and data redundancy. Replica sets consist of primary and secondary nodes that automatically handle failover.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Built-in Sharding:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB’s sharding allows for distributing data across multiple servers. This is useful for handling large datasets and balancing the load.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Rich Query Language:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB supports a rich query language that allows for complex queries, including filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Write a Code to Connect MongoDB to Python. Also, Create a Database and a Collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new database\n",
    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new collection\n",
    "collection = db['mycollection']\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Database and collection created successfully.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `MongoClient` is used to connect to the MongoDB server running on localhost at port 27017.\n",
    "- `client['mydatabase']` creates a new database named `mydatabase`.\n",
    "- `db['mycollection']` creates a new collection named `mycollection` within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Using the Database and Collection Created in Question Number 3, Write a Code to Insert One Record and Insert Many Records. Use the `find()` and `find_one()` Methods to Print the Inserted Record.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "collection = db['mycollection']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "collection.insert_one({\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert many records\n",
    "records = [\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"San Francisco\"},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35, \"city\": \"Los Angeles\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "collection.insert_many(records)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find and print one record\n",
    "one_record = collection.find_one({\"name\": \"Alice\"})\n",
    "print(\"Find one record:\", one_record)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find and print all records\n",
    "all_records = collection.find()\n",
    "print(\"Find all records:\")\n",
    "for record in all_records:\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the connection\n",
    "client.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `insert_one()` inserts a single document into the collection.\n",
    "- `insert_many()` inserts multiple documents.\n",
    "- `find_one()` retrieves a single document matching the query.\n",
    "- `find()` retrieves all documents in the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Explain How You Can Use the `find()` Method to Query the MongoDB Database. Write a Simple Code to Demonstrate This.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using `find()` Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `find()` method is used to query the database and retrieve multiple documents that match the specified query criteria. It returns a cursor, which can be iterated over to access the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "collection = db['mycollection']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query documents where age is greater than 25\n",
    "query = {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 25}}\n",
    "cursor = collection.find(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the results\n",
    "print(\"Documents where age > 25:\")\n",
    "for document in cursor:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the connection\n",
    "client.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `{ \"age\": { \"$gt\": 25 } }` is a query that selects documents where the age field is greater than 25.\n",
    "- `find(query)` returns a cursor for the query results, which is then iterated to print each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Explain the `sort()` Method. Give an Example to Demonstrate Sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`sort()` Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sort()` method in MongoDB is used to sort the query results based on one or more fields. Sorting can be done in ascending (`1`) or descending (`-1`) order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "collection = db['mycollection']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert some example records\n",
    "collection.insert_many([\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35}\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query and sort documents by age in descending order\n",
    "cursor = collection.find().sort(\"age\", -1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the sorted results\n",
    "print(\"Documents sorted by age (descending):\")\n",
    "for document in cursor:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the connection\n",
    "client.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `.sort(\"age\", -1)` sorts the results by the `age` field in descending order. Use `1` for ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Explain Why `delete_one()`, `delete_many()`, and `drop()` are Used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`delete_one()` Method:**\n",
    "- **Usage:** Deletes a single document that matches the specified query.\n",
    "- **Example:** `collection.delete_one({\"name\": \"Alice\"})` removes the first document where the `name` is \"Alice\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**`delete_many()` Method:**\n",
    "- **Usage:** Deletes multiple documents that match the specified query.\n",
    "- **Example:** `collection.delete_many({\"age\": {\"$lt\": 30}})` removes all documents where the `age` is less than 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`drop()` Method:**\n",
    "- **Usage:** Deletes an entire collection from the database, including all documents and indexes.\n",
    "- **Example:** `collection.drop()` removes the `mycollection` collection from the `mydatabase` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **`delete_one()`** is used when you need to remove a specific document.\n",
    "- **`delete_many()`** is used to remove multiple documents based on a condition.\n",
    "- **`drop()`** is used when you need to remove a collection entirely, which is useful for cleanup or when you no longer need the collection."
