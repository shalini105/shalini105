    "### **Q1. What is Abstraction in OOPs?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** is the process of hiding the internal implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary features or functionality. It helps reduce complexity by focusing on what an object does instead of how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "Imagine a car. When you drive, you only use the steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes without worrying about how the engine works. This is abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Vehicle(ABC):  # Abstract class\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):  # Concrete class\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Car engine started.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Bike(Vehicle):  # Concrete class\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Bike engine started.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using abstraction\n",
    "vehicles = [Car(), Bike()]\n",
    "for vehicle in vehicles:\n",
    "    vehicle.start_engine()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Car engine started.\n",
    "# Bike engine started.\n",

    "### **Q3. What is `abc` Module in Python? Why Is It Used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` (Abstract Base Class) module in Python provides tools for defining abstract base classes, which are classes that cannot be instantiated directly. Abstract base classes define methods that **must** be implemented by their subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why is it used?**\n",
    "  - Enforces a contract for subclass implementations.\n",
    "  - Ensures that all required methods are implemented in the child classes.\n",
    "  - Provides a clear and structured way to implement abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",

    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",

    "Data abstraction in Python can be achieved using:\n",
    "1. **Abstract Base Classes (ABC)**: Use the `abc` module to define abstract methods.\n",
    "2. **Hiding Implementation with Private Members**: Use encapsulation to hide the internal details of a class.\n",

    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Using Encapsulation**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",

    "### **Q5. Can We Create an Instance of an Abstract Class?**\n",
    "\n",
    "No, you **cannot create an instance of an abstract class**. Abstract classes are designed to provide a template for other classes. They may contain abstract methods, which are methods without implementation. Attempting to instantiate an abstract class will result in a `TypeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Not?**\n",
    "- Abstract classes are incomplete by design. They exist to enforce the implementation of certain methods in subclasses.\n",
