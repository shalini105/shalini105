    "### Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments in Python** are used to explain and annotate your code. They are not executed by the interpreter. There are two main types of comments in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single-Line Comments**: These are used to comment on a single line of code. They start with the `#` symbol.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # This is a single-line comment\n",
    "   print(\"Hello, World!\")  # This prints a greeting message\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-Line Comments**: Python does not have a dedicated syntax for multi-line comments. Instead, multi-line comments are often written using a series of single-line comments or triple-quoted strings (`'''` or `\"\"\"`). Though triple-quoted strings are technically not comments, they are often used for multi-line comments or docstrings.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   \"\"\"\n",
    "   This is a multi-line comment.\n",
    "   It spans multiple lines.\n",
    "   \"\"\"\n",
    "   print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables** in Python are names that refer to values stored in memory. They allow you to store, modify, and retrieve data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Declaring and Assigning Values:**\n",
    "In Python, you do not need to declare the type of the variable explicitly; it is determined automatically based on the assigned value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Declare a variable and assign a value\n",
    "age = 25            # integer variable\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"      # string variable\n",
    "height = 5.6        # float variable\n",
    "is_student = True   # boolean variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. How do you convert one data type to another in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type conversion** in Python is done using built-in functions. Here are common conversions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **To Integer**: `int()`\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  num_str = \"123\"\n",
    "  num_int = int(num_str)  # Converts string to integer\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **To Float**: `float()`\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  num_int = 10\n",
    "  num_float = float(num_int)  # Converts integer to float\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **To String**: `str()`\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  num = 456\n",
    "  num_str = str(num)  # Converts integer to string\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **To Boolean**: `bool()`\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  num = 0\n",
    "  bool_value = bool(num)  # Converts number to boolean (0 is False, non-zero is True)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. How do you write and execute a Python script from the command line?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Write a Python Script**: Create a file with a `.py` extension, such as `script.py`, and write your Python code in it.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # script.py\n",
    "   print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Execute the Python Script**:\n",
    "   Open your command line (Terminal or Command Prompt) and run the script using the `python` command (or `python3` if using Python 3).\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   python script.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you are using Python 3, you might need to use:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   python3 script.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Given a list `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, write the code to slice the list and obtain the sub-list `[2, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slicing a List**: You can use list slicing to get a sub-list. Slicing is done using the `start:stop` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "sub_list = my_list[1:3]  # This gets elements from index 1 to 2 (3 is not included)\n",
    "print(sub_list)  # Output: [2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. What is a complex number in mathematics, and how is it represented in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complex Number**: In mathematics, a complex number has a real part and an imaginary part. It is generally expressed as \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Representation in Python**: Python has built-in support for complex numbers. You can represent complex numbers using the `j` suffix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Complex number with real part 2 and imaginary part 3\n",
    "c = 2 + 3j\n",
    "print(c)  # Output: (2+3j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. What is the correct way to declare a variable named `age` and assign the value `25` to it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Declaration and Assignment:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 25  # Declare variable 'age' and assign it the integer value 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. Declare a variable named `price` and assign the value `9.99` to it. What data type does this variable belong to?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Declaration and Assignment:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "price = 9.99  # Declare variable 'price' and assign it the float value 9.99\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `price` belongs to the `float` data type because it represents a number with a decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9. Create a variable named `name` and assign your full name to it as a string. How would you print the value of this variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Declaration and Printing:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"John Doe\"  # Replace \"John Doe\" with your full name\n",
    "print(name)        # This will print the value of the variable 'name'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q10. Given the string `\"Hello, World!\"`, extract the substring `\"World\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extracting Substring**: Use slicing to obtain the substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "substring = s[7:12]  # Start index 7, end index 12 (not inclusive)\n",
    "print(substring)    # Output: World\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q11. Create a variable named `is_student` and assign it a boolean value indicating whether you are currently a student or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Declaration and Assignment:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "is_student = True  # If you are a student, use True; otherwise, use False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This covers the basics of each question. Feel free to ask if you need more details on any specific topic!e\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-Line Comments**: Python does not have a dedicated syntax for multi-line comments.
