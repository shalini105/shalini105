    "### **Q1. What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiprocessing** in Python is a technique that allows the execution of multiple processes simultaneously. Each process runs independently and has its own memory space, enabling true parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it useful?**\n",
    "1. **Improved Performance for CPU-bound Tasks:** Multiprocessing utilizes multiple CPU cores to execute tasks in parallel, making it suitable for computationally intensive operations.\n",
    "2. **Isolation:** Processes do not share memory space, reducing risks of data corruption.\n",
    "3. **Scalability:** It enables better utilization of multi-core processors.\n",
    "4. **Concurrency and Parallelism:** Helps in achieving true parallelism, unlike multithreading limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.\n",

    "### **Q4. What is a multiprocessing pool in Python? Why is it used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **multiprocessing pool** in Python is a collection of worker processes that execute tasks in parallel. It simplifies task distribution across multiple processes by managing them internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it used?**\n",
    "1. **Task Parallelism:** Automates splitting and distributing tasks among workers.\n",
    "2. **Resource Management:** Controls the number of concurrent processes.\n",
    "3. **Simplified API:** Methods like `apply()`, `map()`, and `starmap()` make it easy to execute tasks in parallel.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q5. How can we create a pool of worker processes in Python using the multiprocessing module?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `Pool` class from the `multiprocessing` module to create a pool of worker processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(number):\n",
    "    return number * number\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4) as pool:\n",
    "        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "        results = pool.map(square, numbers)\n",
    "        print(\"Squares:\", results)\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q6. Write a Python program to create 4 processes, each process should print a different number using the multiprocessing module in Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_number(number):\n",
    "    print(f\"Process ID: {multiprocessing.current_process().pid} - Number: {number}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]  # Numbers to print\n",
    "    processes = []\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create and start processes\n",
    "    for number in numbers:\n",
    "        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_number, args=(number,))\n",
    "        processes.append(process)\n",
    "        process.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Wait for all processes to complete\n",
    "    for process in processes:\n",
    "        process.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"All processes completed!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "1. **`multiprocessing.Process`:** Creates a process for each number in the list.\n",
    "2. **`start()`:** Starts the process.\n",
    "3. **`join()`:** Ensures the main program waits for all processes to finish.\n",
    "4. **Output:** Each process prints its assigned number along with its unique Process ID."
